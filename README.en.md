# bebasit
bebasit is a derivative repo of bebasid containing applications for deep packet inspection (DPI) bypassing.

<a href="README.md">Indonesia</a> | <b>English</b>
## List of Applications
Here is a list of applications that have already been tested regarding DPI bypass capability.
### Windows
- GoodbyeDPI.
- PowerTunnel (JRE).
### Linux
- Green Tunnel (NodeJS + NPM).
- PowerTunnel (JRE).
- Zapret (currently it is still under the testing phase as Zapret does not include DoH within tpws).
### Mac
- Green Tunnel (NodeJS + NPM).
- PowerTunnel (JRE).
## Note
### Windows
- Not all versions of Windows will work, for example, Windows 7 without any updates needs KBxxxxxx.
### Linux and MacOS
- Green Tunnel usability depends on luck (it does not mean that Green Tunnel cannot bypass DPI).
### Addendum
- The version of applications inside this repo does not use an auto-update scheme to the latest version because a new feature of the application might not be useful.
### Why bebasid and bebasit are separate
- Easing control of application suitability.
- If applications like GoodbyeDPI, Green Tunnel, PowerTunnel, and Zapret are included within the bebasid repo, it would consume more data. In many cases, people use the `git clone` command when downloading bebasid and it caused the Mac version of the app to be downloaded as well in Windows.
- New project.
- To make bebasid looks more formal.
