bebasit is a derivative repo of bebasid containing applications for deep packet inspection (DPI) bypassing.

<a href="README.md">Indonesia</a> | <b>English</b>
## List of Application
Here is a list of application that already tested in regards to DPI bypass capability.
### Windows
- GoodbyeDPI.
- PowerTunnel (JRE).
### Linux
- Green Tunnel (NodeJS + NPM).
- PowerTunnel (JRE).
- Zapret (currently it is still under testing phase as zapret does not include DoH within tpws).
### Mac
- Green Tunnel (NodeJS + NPM).
- PowerTunnel (JRE).
## Note
### Windows
- Not all version of Windows will work, for example Windows 7 without any update has a problem, it needs KBxxxxxx.
### Linux and MacOS
- Green Tunnel usability is depending on luck (it does not mean that Green Tunnel cannot bypass DPI).
### Addendum
- Version of application inside this repo does not use autoupdate scheme to latest version because a new feature of application might not be useful.
### Why bebasid and bebasit are separate
- Easing control of application suitability.
- If applications like GoodbyeDPI, Green Tunnel, PowerTunnel, and Zapret are included within bebasid repo, it would consume more data. In many cases, people use `git clone` command when downloading bebasid and it caused Mac version of the app being downloaded as well in Windows.
- New project.
- To make bebasid looks more formal.
